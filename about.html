                <p>My name is Hallie, I was born in Springfield, Missouri up until I was 17.
                    Just before my senior year of high school, My parents decided to move to 
                    Crested Butte, Colorado where I finished up the rest of high school and went
                    on to study art history at the local university. However, it wasn't long before
                    I figured out that being told what to paint and draw wasn't my thing. 
                    I stayed away from school for a few years doing odd jobs and art in my free time
                    until me and my now Hhusband moved to Denver where odd jobs weren't all too odd anymore
                    and I needed something more secure. So, here I am, many jobs and art endeavors later!
